Hi! My name’s Arman. This blog contains my thoughts on architecture, computer, philosophy, and also random things that cross my mind.  

I’m from Indonesia, so maybe you’ll find some articles in Bahasa Indonesia here :)  

I also write for [Medium](https://armanwu.medium.com/), [Kompasiana](https://www.kompasiana.com/armanwu), and [Fedora Magazine](https://fedoramagazine.org/author/armanwu/).

You can see my research papers on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Arman-Arisman) and connect with me by sending an email to arman.wu@gmail.com
